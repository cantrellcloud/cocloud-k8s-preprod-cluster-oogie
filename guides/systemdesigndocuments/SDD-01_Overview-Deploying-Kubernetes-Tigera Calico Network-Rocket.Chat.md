### System Design Document for Deploying Kubernetes, Tigera Calico VXLAN Network Overlay, and Rocket.Chat (On-Premises)

#### 1. **Introduction**

This document outlines the system design for deploying Kubernetes clusters with Tigera Calico VXLAN network overlay and Rocket.Chat in an on-premises environment. The design includes global Enterprise DNS, load balancing options, and ensures high availability, failover, and redundancies across three data centers without relying on cloud services or the Internet.

#### 2. **Architecture Overview**

The architecture consists of:

- **Kubernetes Clusters**: Deployed across three on-premises data centers.
- **Tigera Calico VXLAN**: For network overlay.
- **Rocket.Chat**: Deployed on Kubernetes.
- **Global Enterprise DNS**: For domain name resolution.
- **Load Balancing**: To distribute traffic and ensure high availability.

#### 3. **Kubernetes Deployment**

- **Cluster Setup**: Deploy Kubernetes clusters in three on-premises data centers.
  - **Control Plane**: Ensure each data center has its own control plane for redundancy.
  - **Worker Nodes**: Distribute worker nodes across data centers.
- **High Availability**: Use multiple master nodes and etcd clusters to ensure high availability.
- **Failover**: Implement automated failover mechanisms to switch to a standby cluster in case of failure.

#### 4. **Tigera Calico VXLAN Network Overlay**

- **Network Configuration**: Configure Calico to use VXLAN for network overlay.
  - **Encapsulation**: Use VXLAN to encapsulate traffic between pods across different data centers.
  - **Cluster Mesh**: Set up a cluster mesh to enable communication between clusters.
- **Routing**: Ensure proper routing of traffic between clusters using Calico's BGP capabilities.

#### 5. **Rocket.Chat Deployment**

- **Deployment Method**: Use Kubernetes Helm charts to deploy Rocket.Chat.
  - **Scaling**: Configure Rocket.Chat to scale horizontally to handle increased load.
  - **Persistence**: Use persistent storage for Rocket.Chat data to ensure data durability.
- **High Availability**: Deploy multiple instances of Rocket.Chat across the clusters to ensure availability.

#### 6. **Global Enterprise DNS**

- **DNS Configuration**: Use an on-premises DNS solution to manage domain name resolution.
  - **DNS Servers**: Deploy DNS servers in each data center for redundancy.
  - **Geo-Location Routing**: Configure DNS to route users to the nearest data center based on their location.

#### 7. **Load Balancing Options**

- **Global Load Balancing**: Implement Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across data centers.
  - **Load Balancers**: Use on-premises load balancers such as F5 BIG-IP, Citrix ADC, or HAProxy.
  - **Health Checks**: Configure health checks to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances.

#### 8. **High Availability, Failover, and Redundancies**

- **Redundancy**: Ensure redundancy at all levels (control plane, worker nodes, network, and storage).
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Implement automated failover mechanisms to switch traffic to standby clusters in case of failure.
- **Data Replication**: Use data replication across data centers to ensure data availability and consistency.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement regular backups and disaster recovery plans to restore services in case of a major failure.

#### 9. **Security Considerations**

- **Network Policies**: Use Calico network policies to secure pod communication.
- **Access Control**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes to manage permissions.
- **Encryption**: Ensure data encryption in transit and at rest.

#### 10. **Monitoring and Logging**

- **Monitoring Tools**: Use on-premises monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring cluster health and performance.
- **Logging**: Implement centralized logging using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd.
