### What is vSphere Supervisor?

vSphere Supervisor is a feature within VMware vSphere that transforms vSphere clusters into a platform for running Kubernetes workloads natively on the hypervisor layer. When enabled, it creates a Kubernetes control plane directly on ESXi hosts, allowing for seamless integration and management of Kubernetes workloads alongside traditional virtual machines[1](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/vsphere-supervisor-concepts-and-planning/vsphere-iaas-control-plane-concepts/what-is-vsphere-with-tanzu.html).

#### Key Features of vSphere Supervisor

1. **Kubernetes Control Plane**:
   - vSphere Supervisor creates a Kubernetes control plane on the hypervisor layer, enabling the deployment and management of Kubernetes workloads directly on ESXi hosts[1](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/vsphere-supervisor-concepts-and-planning/vsphere-iaas-control-plane-concepts/what-is-vsphere-with-tanzu.html).

2. **vSphere Namespaces**:
   - vSphere Supervisor introduces the concept of vSphere Namespaces, which are dedicated resource pools within a vSphere cluster. These namespaces can be configured with specific amounts of CPU, memory, and storage, and are provided to DevOps engineers for running Kubernetes workloads[2](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/vsphere-supervisor-concepts-and-planning/vsphere-iaas-control-plane-concepts.html).

3. **Integration with vSphere Features**:
   - vSphere Supervisor integrates with existing vSphere features such as vCenter Single Sign-On (SSO), networking, and storage. This integration provides a unified management experience for both virtual machines and Kubernetes workloads[1](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/vsphere-supervisor-concepts-and-planning/vsphere-iaas-control-plane-concepts/what-is-vsphere-with-tanzu.html).

4. **Enhanced Visibility and Control**:
   - By creating a Kubernetes layer within the vSphere environment, vSphere Supervisor provides enhanced visibility and control over the entire stack. This includes the ability to monitor and manage both virtual machines and Kubernetes pods from a single interface[1](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/vsphere-supervisor-concepts-and-planning/vsphere-iaas-control-plane-concepts/what-is-vsphere-with-tanzu.html).

#### Benefits of Using vSphere Supervisor

- **Resource Efficiency**: Running Kubernetes workloads directly on the hypervisor layer eliminates the need for nested virtualization, leading to better resource utilization and performance.
- **Simplified Management**: vSphere Supervisor simplifies the management of Kubernetes workloads by integrating them into the familiar vSphere environment, reducing the complexity of managing separate infrastructure layers.
- **Scalability**: vSphere Supervisor allows for easy scaling of Kubernetes clusters by leveraging the underlying vSphere infrastructure, making it easier to handle growing workloads[2](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/vsphere-supervisor-concepts-and-planning/vsphere-iaas-control-plane-concepts.html).

#### Hardware and Infrastructure Requirements

1. **vSphere Cluster**:
   - For production environments, you need at least three ESXi hosts in a cluster. If using vSAN, the cluster must have at least four hosts[1](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/installing-and-configuring-vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-installation-and-configuration-workflow/prerequisites-for-enabling-workload-management.html).
   - For proof-of-concept or test environments, a minimum of one host is required[1](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/installing-and-configuring-vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-installation-and-configuration-workflow/prerequisites-for-enabling-workload-management.html).

2. **Shared Storage**:
   - The cluster must be configured with shared storage, such as vSAN, to support vSphere High Availability (HA), Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS), and persistent container volumes[1](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-cis/vsphere/vsphere-supervisor/8-0/installing-and-configuring-vsphere-supervisor/supervisor-installation-and-configuration-workflow/prerequisites-for-enabling-workload-management.html).

     ```

3. **Access the Cluster**:
   - Once the cluster is created, configure kubectl to access it:

     ```sh
     tanzu cluster kubeconfig get <cluster-name> --admin
     kubectl config use-context <cluster-name>-admin@<cluster-name>
     ```

#### Step 5: Manage the Cluster

1. **Deploy Applications**:
   - Use kubectl to deploy applications to your new Tanzu Kubernetes cluster:

     ```sh
     kubectl apply -f <application-manifest>.yaml
     ```

2. **Scale and Update Clusters**:
   - Scale the cluster as needed:

     ```sh
     tanzu cluster scale <cluster-name> --worker-machine-count <number-of-workers>
     ```

   - Update the cluster:

     ```sh
     tanzu cluster upgrade <cluster-name>
     ```

These steps should help you deploy and manage Tanzu Kubernetes clusters using the Tanzu CLI. If you need more detailed guidance, refer to the official VMware documentation[1](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/standalone-components/tanzu-kubernetes-grid/2-5/tkg/install-cli.html)[2](https://techdocs.broadcom.com/us/en/vmware-tanzu/standalone-components/tanzu-kubernetes-grid/2-5/tkg/mgmt-index.html).

### Avi Load Balancer

Yes, the Avi Load Balancer, also known as the NSX Advanced Load Balancer, can be integrated with VMware Tanzu. It provides dynamically scaling load balancing endpoints for Tanzu Kubernetes clusters[1](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-8908FAD7-9343-491B-9F6B-45FA8893C8CC.html). When you configure the Avi Controller, it automatically provisions load balancing endpoints for your Kubernetes clusters, creating virtual services and deploying Service Engine VMs to host those services[1](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-8908FAD7-9343-491B-9F6B-45FA8893C8CC.html).

VMware Tanzu also has built-in load balancing capabilities. For example, you can create a Kubernetes service of type `LoadBalancer` to provision an external load balancer for your Tanzu Kubernetes clusters[2](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/vmware-vsphere-with-tanzu/GUID-D1451EA0-C39F-44F6-A9A9-68AA89328003.html).
