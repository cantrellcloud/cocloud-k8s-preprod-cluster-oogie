### System Design Document for Deploying Kubernetes On-Premises Without Online Repos, Cloud Services, or the Internet

#### 1. **Introduction**

This document outlines the system design for deploying Kubernetes clusters in an on-premises environment without access to online repositories, cloud services, or the Internet. The design ensures high availability, failover, and redundancies across three data centers.

#### 2. **Architecture Overview**

The architecture consists of:

- **Kubernetes Clusters**: Deployed across three on-premises data centers.
- **Local Repositories**: For Kubernetes and application images.
- **Load Balancing**: To distribute traffic and ensure high availability.

#### 3. **Kubernetes Deployment**

- **Cluster Setup**: Deploy Kubernetes clusters in three on-premises data centers.
  - **Control Plane**: Ensure each data center has its own control plane for redundancy.
  - **Worker Nodes**: Distribute worker nodes across data centers.
- **High Availability**: Use multiple master nodes and etcd clusters to ensure high availability.
- **Failover**: Implement automated failover mechanisms to switch to a standby cluster in case of failure.

#### 4. **Local Repositories**

- **Image Repository**: Set up a local Docker registry to store Kubernetes and application images.
  - **Repository Management**: Use tools like Harbor or Nexus Repository Manager to manage local repositories.
  - **Image Distribution**: Ensure all necessary images are pre-loaded into the local registry.

#### 5. **Load Balancing Options**

- **Global Load Balancing**: Implement Global Server Load Balancing (GSLB) to distribute traffic across data centers.
  - **Load Balancers**: Use on-premises load balancers such as F5 BIG-IP, Citrix ADC, or HAProxy.
  - **Health Checks**: Configure health checks to ensure traffic is only routed to healthy instances.

#### 6. **High Availability, Failover, and Redundancies**

- **Redundancy**: Ensure redundancy at all levels (control plane, worker nodes, network, and storage).
- **Failover Mechanisms**: Implement automated failover mechanisms to switch traffic to standby clusters in case of failure.
- **Data Replication**: Use data replication across data centers to ensure data availability and consistency.
- **Backup and Recovery**: Implement regular backups and disaster recovery plans to restore services in case of a major failure.

#### 7. **Security Considerations**

- **Network Policies**: Use network policies to secure pod communication.
- **Access Control**: Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Kubernetes to manage permissions.
- **Encryption**: Ensure data encryption in transit and at rest.

#### 8. **Monitoring and Logging**

- **Monitoring Tools**: Use on-premises monitoring tools like Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring cluster health and performance.
- **Logging**: Implement centralized logging using tools like ELK stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana) or Fluentd.
